This school was established in the year 2005 by ISHITA, the then Zonal Director, in a remote rural area lacking in adequate infrastructure. Previously, it was a feeder branch of R.S  Public School, mandi, punjab. Now, it has been separated (In 2011) and proved itself capable of imparting value-education to the students who belong to the socially and economically backward society. This has been motto of this institution since its inauguration to disseminate the light of the great Veda among the children of this flood effected and poverty ridden area where most of them are deprived of the systematic intellectual and spiritual development. It imparts education up to class VII. It has trained the pupil to prove themselves worthy in every sphere of life. The students of this school have proved themselves by participating in quiz and other competitions that have been held by different organizations. It imparts free education those students who follow the moral value of life and are unable to afford their study here. The motto of this school is imparting quality education imbued with values.
