<h3> TO K.N.PUBLIC SCHOOL</h3>
<p>
A diamond glitters not until it has been cut, shaped and polished. Not until then can its beauty be appreciated, or its sparkling daintiness be realized. Only under the superb craftsmanship and artistic talents of expert cutters and polishers do the latent qualities become apparent. School Knowledge, like a coat of paint can be applied, but some day will crack and peel. However, the education you receive will remain those habits of mind such as logical thinking, perseverance, optimism, prompt and devoted response to duty. Thus with the knowledge they have stored up and the he education they have day will crack and peel receive will remain those habits of mind such as logical

<p> K.N. PUBLIC SHOLL is the brain-child of Late Mahatma Narayan Das Grover, hon’ble Regional Director and Vice-President of DAV College Managing Committee, New Delhi. This school is a part of India’s largest chain of Public Schools inspired by the great visionaries- Swami DayanandSaraswati, Mahatma Hansraj, Late LajpatRai and many more.
The sole aim of this school is to inculcate, nurture and strengthen the values of honesty, truthfulness, hard work, sincerity, patriotism, kindness and co-operation in the minds of budding children so that they could become steadfast, responsible citizens with high ethical and moral values. Our motto is to make our children known not merely by their worldly riches and success but also by their moral strength. We strongly believe that the ‘Anglo-Vedic’ sprit has to be developed in our pupils that will enable them to live a life of true contentment of both internal and external prosperity. Here, we remember the great men by celebrating their ‘birth-anniversaries’ and ‘NirvanDiwas’ with grace, dignity, and solemnity with the aim that our pupils would  draw inspiration from the lives of these ‘great-souls’ and experience eternal solace and explore new horizons and breach new limitations----always, because ‘sky is the limit’. We aim to propagate the proud legacy of India’s glorious civilization and amalgamate it with all the modern technological and scientific knowledge for the service of the nation and of humanity at large. We may not always create future for our children but we can always create children for the future!
